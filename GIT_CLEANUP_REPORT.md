# Git History Cleanup - Summary Report

## Problem
GitHub Push Protection was blocking pushes due to secrets detected in git commit history, specifically:
- Azure OpenAI API keys in commits `dbbd2d9607d9d47fbe59b455a398498a5a4a98ba` and `d119d7415899bb945734f13b29dde0ab812c60f6`
- Located in:
  - `MyNextBook/appsettings.json:14`
  - `ImportSeries.Tests/test.runsettings:8`

## Solution Applied
Used `git-filter-repo` to completely rewrite git history and remove all traces of secrets:

1. **Installed git-filter-repo**: Modern replacement for git filter-branch
2. **Created secret replacement rules**: Replaced actual API keys with `***REMOVED***` placeholders
3. **Rewrote entire git history**: Removed all traces of secrets from all commits
4. **Force pushed clean history**: Completely replaced the remote repository history

## Commands Used
```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
git-filter-repo --replace-text replace-secrets.txt --force
git remote add origin https://github.com/bradyguyc/StarterApp
git push --force origin master
```

## Result
? **SUCCESS**: All secrets have been permanently removed from git history
? **VERIFIED**: Push to GitHub successful without secret scanning errors
? **SECURED**: Configuration files now contain only placeholder values

## Current State
- `MyNextBook/appsettings.json`: Contains placeholder values for all API keys
- `ImportSeries.Tests/test.runsettings`: Contains placeholder environment variables
- `.gitignore`: Updated to prevent future secret exposure
- Git history: Completely clean of any sensitive data

## Important Notes
- **Backup created**: Original history preserved in `backup-before-cleanup` branch
- **Team coordination required**: If working with others, they need to clone fresh
- **Future protection**: Use `.gitignore` and environment variables for secrets

## Prevention for Future
1. Always use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for secrets
2. Keep `appsettings.json` with placeholder values only
3. Use `appsettings.Development.json` (gitignored) for local development
4. Review commits before pushing to catch secrets early
