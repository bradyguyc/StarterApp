# A .NET MAUI Starter App

I found that as I started developing multiple different apps I wanted to be able to start with a basic set of capablities.  This project is where I am building out a starter app for such a purpose.

### Features of Starter App
* App Icon and Splash Screen
    For some reason I really don't like the .NET colors and default appicon so it's the first thing I setup.
* Standard Error Popup Notification 
* Azure AD B2B / Customer / Entra Authentication
* Calling Azure Functions with EasyAuth and Entra Authorization methods
*
